    await session.login('your.email@efood.gr', 'your-password');

    let addresses = await session.getUserAddresses();

    let nearbyStores = await session.getStores({
        latitude: address.latitude,
        longitude: address.longitude,
        onlyOpen: true
    });

    await session.setStore(nearbyStores[0].id);

    // See how it's done in src/commands/addcart.ts

    await session.validateOrder();

### Console usage
Just type `efood` to enter the console and then `help` to see available commands. Not all commands exist/behave the same in the console environment.

### Build
If you want to build this package into a standalone binary for your OS, you can use [nexe](https://github.com/jaredallard/nexe)
```sh
npm i -g nexe
git clone https://github.com/kpapadatos/efoodgr
cd efoodgr
npm i
nexe -i bin/efood.js -o efood.exe
```

#### Notes
- It may take some time as it downloads the latest NodeJS source and builds it.
- If you get errors about `try-thread-sleep` and `thread-sleep` modules missing, you may need to create their folders in `node_modules` with a dummy `package.json` to fool `browserify` that they exist.

### Contribute

- Paypal support
